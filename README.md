# CPSC210 BlackJack Game - Term Project

Want to play some risk-free BlackJack? This is the perfect application

## Overview:

**What will the application do?**

This application aims to provide users with the traditional BlackJack experience in a risk-free environment where money is irrelevant.
In this application the user will be able to bet "money" and play BlackJack according to their own decisions.
The users will also be able to save their progress (their balance) whenever they want.

**Who will use it?**

This application is intended for people who like to play BlackJack. 
Also, for people who have never played BlackJack and would want to play it without real money for their first time.


**Why is it of interest to me?**

BlackJack is one of my favourite games to play when I am at the casino. 
I find that I have the best odds of winning when I play it compared to games such as roulette.
Even though the game is played with betting real money I wanted to create a risk-free environment where I can play this game without being worried about losing money.
Being in this risk-free environment also lets me practice Basic Strategy without the pressure of being in the casino.
